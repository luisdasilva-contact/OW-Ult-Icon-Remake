# OW-Ult-Icon-Remake
Working files for a project where I made a loading animation in Unity, mimicking the Ultimate loading animation from Overwatch as closely as possible! 

Made purely for educational purposes. If you'd like to use any of these assets (i.e. the lightning bolts), feel free; I just ask that you credit me. K2D font designed by Cadson Demak, and used under the Open Font license. 
These items were designed for Unity's URP. Post Processing must be enabled on your camera, and HDR must be enabled in the Pipeline settings. The ultIcon and UIMaster prefabs (Prefabs --> masterPefabs) are the only items needed to include in a scene for this project to work. Note, however, that the ultIcon prefab must be attached to a Canvas, as it utilizes a number of Canvas-specific components. The Canvas itself will also need to be plugged into the UIMaster via the Script component in the Inspector panel.
